##Coffee Machine Simulator
My project that is made for Estonian IT College in Basic Programming course.

##Motivation
It was my first experince with writing a program in Java. I decided to make a coffee machine simulator because it's very unusual idea and there isn't much examples in the internet. So it was interesting to check if i'll able to do it by myself)

##Dependencies
This project was made in NetBeans IDE. I used Swing for graphical interface.
So, if you want to successfully compile and run my project, you will need this IDE and additional lib: awtextra. You can get it from NetBeans without any additional sources

##Contributors
If you want to help me to improve my project - you can fork my repository and send me your changes.
Looking forward to your feedback and advices.
